# Objective
The purpose of OHDSI's Gold Standard Phenotype Library is to enable members of the OHDSI community to find, evaluate, and utilize community-validated cohort definitions for research and other activities. The phenotypes which reside in this library are "Gold Standard" definitions, which means that the entries are:

- **Designed** with the best practices
- **Evaluated** with the best practices
- **Documented** with the best practices

In general, no phenotype entries are excluded as long as these "Gold Standard Processess" were followed; a judgment about what qualifies as "good" or "poor" performance is situational and is therefore left up to the user.

# PhenoPipe
This application, **PhenoPipe**, is designed to get you to the Gold Standard phenotype as quickly as possible. In the **Find** tab, search for the phenotype you're looking for, subject to filters which qualify the construction and performance characteristics that you find acceptable. **Inspect** all of your selections to compare/contrast them and review their purposes and user stories. Finally, **Export** the phenotype in a format of your choice to proceed with your implementation.

# Gold Standard Criteria
**To Do:** Fill this part in with the precise standards the WG agrees to.
